                <p>I've always been playing games for 
                    as long as I can remember. I first started on the old 
                    PC's when we still used floppy disks lol. And then, on
                    Console when I got my very own PlayStation 2 at 7 years old.</p>

          <h3><b>Baking</b></h3>
          <p>I think it's worth bragging that I baked my 
            first cake at the tender age of 3. I've got to give my Grandma some 
            credit though for always making the best cakes and pastries and teaching me 
            all the tricks. I've loved baking ever since.

          <h3><b>Gardening</b></h3>
          <p>Something I also really enjoy doing is growing my own 
            vegetables (I haven't gotten to growing fruits yet) and 
            watching something grow from just a little seed.

            <h1>| About Me</h1>
            <p>I got into coding quite late in my life,
                after having already studied something
                in a completely different field for more 
                than 8 years.</p>
            <p>However, coding is something I've always 
                wanted to do, initially because I wanted to learn
                how to hack lol. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I now seriously enjoy what I'm doing
                unlike before and want to become skilled 
                in as much programming languages as I can.
            </p>
            <p>
                My short term goal is to become a competent web
                 developer and eventually to get into game development,
                  as well as UX Design and Cybersecurity.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've managed to so far create the layout of a 
                game I'm trying to make using Blender and Unity, 
                which has been challenging but super fun.
            </p>
